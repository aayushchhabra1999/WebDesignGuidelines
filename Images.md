# Images

1. Put text directly on the image. This only works if the image is dark and text is light. Otherwise, not enough contrast and hard to read.

2. The best solution to the above problem is to overlay the image with a color. The most usual color used is black. It turns the image darker and allows us to easily place text on top which is easy to read. Other colors are fine too if used smartly with the main color of the website.

3. A nice overlay can also be done by using colored gradients.

4. Another solution is to have a box on the image and put the text in the box to stand out.

5. Another common solution is the image blur. Either blur the whole image or use an out-of-focus area of the photo as the blur. One important consideration for this case is to ensure that the text remains on the blurred region for all devices (responsive web design).

6. **Floor Fade** - Technique where an image subtly fades towards black at the bottom with white text written over it.
