# Spacing and Layout

1. Use Whitespace
    - Put whitespace between your elements.
    - Put whitespace between your group of elements.
    - Put whitespace between your website's sections.
    - But don't exaggerate

2. Define Hierarchy: Whitespace describes invisible relationships between the elements of your website.
    - Define where you want your audience to look first.
    - Establish a flow that corresponds to your content's message.
    - Use whitespace to build that flow.
