# Color

1. Use only one base color. Too many colors look horrible.

- A good resource to pick base colors is
  [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com).

2. Besides a base color, you can pick a lighter and darker shade of the base color to create a nice color palette.

   - A good resource to create lighter and darker shades is [0 to 255](https://www.0to255.com/).

3. Always stick to a color palette instead of randomly choosing different colors at different places of the website.

4. If you really want to use multiple colors, use a color wheel tool like [Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) or [Paletton](https://paletton.com/). These tools use color theory to come up with colors that make sense.

5. If you use multiple colors, a good design choice is to use a main color for most of the website with a second color to draw attention to elements of action like buttons _(or other clickable things)_.
