# Typography Guidelines

1. **FONT SIZE**- Use a font-size between `15 and 25 pixels` for the body.

2. Use big font sizes for the headlines. 60px, 90px - all fair game. However, if the headline is really big (like 90px), the `font-weight should be low` to prevent the font from looking too bulky.

3. **Line Spacing** - Line spacing should be `between 120 and 150%` of the font-size.

4. `45 to 90 characters per line`. This is to increase the readability for the user based on reading stride.

5. Use good fonts please :
    - Sans-Serif

6. How to choose a font?
    - Choose a font which reflects the look and feel you want for your website.
    - Decide : sans-serif or serif typeface.
    - Use a good font for the above type.
    - Use only one typeface in general. If for some reason you decide to choose two typefaces, make a compatible choice.
